## Snake Game

### Descriptions

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where you control a green snake navigating a rectangular playing field. The goal is to eat as much food as possible, represented as black squares, to increase your score and grow the snake's length. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging as you must avoid colliding with your own body.

### Rules

1. Move the snake using your up, down, left, and right buttons.
2. The game ends only if the snake's head collides with its own body.
3. The snake grows in length each time it eats food, increasing the difficulty.
4. The snake can cross screen boundaries and will reappear on the opposite side.
5. The player's score increases by 1 for each piece of food eaten.
6. You can pause or resume the game at any time using the space bar.
7. Pressing the escape key immediately exits the game.

### How to play

1. Install the `pygame` library if you don’t have it already:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python snake_game.py
```
